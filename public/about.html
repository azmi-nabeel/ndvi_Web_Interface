      In today's agricultural landscape, there's a notable gap in real-time
      monitoring and personalized care for plant health. This shortfall makes it
      tough for farmers to quickly spot and tackle issues like pests, diseases,
      or nutrient imbalances, ultimately impacting crop yields and quality. It's
      crucial we ramp up our tech solutions and tailor-made strategies to fill
      this void and boost agricultural productivity effectively.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Capture Infrared Images: Farmer launches drone equipped with
            Raspberry Pi and infrared camera to capture high-resolution images
            of crops, revealing plant health and growth patterns
          </li>
          <li>
            Image Processing and NDVI Analysis: Krishi Sevak app processes
            captured images, conducting NDVI analysis to assess crop health and
            identify areas of varying vegetation vigor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Weather Data Integration: App integrates real-time weather data
            (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed) with crop health
            information, offering a holistic view of environmental conditions
            impacting crop growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personalized Recommendations: Krishi Sevak app generates tailored
            recommendations for irrigation scheduling, fertilizer application,
            pest/disease management, and crop rotation strategies, optimizing
            yield and sustainability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alerts and Notifications: App sends timely alerts to farmer
            regarding significant changes in crop health or weather conditions,
            facilitating proactive management and decision-making for enhanced
            productivity

        We plan to do the analysis by making use of Normalized Difference
        Vegetation Index(NDVI) obtained from the drone footage by following
        steps.
        <li>
          Capture Images: Capture both infrared and visible light images of the
          same plantation area. This can be done with specialized cameras such
          as multispectral or near-infrared (NIR) cameras.
        </li>
        <li>Preprocessing: Preprocess the images if required</li>
        <li>
          NDVI Calculation: NDVI = (NIR-RED)/(NIR+RED) NIR: This is the
          intensity of near-infrared light reflected by vegetation. RED: This is
          the intensity of red light reflected by vegetation. This can be
          extracted from the drone footage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Normalize NDVI values: NDVI values typically range from -1 to 1, where
          higher values indicate healthier vegetation. Normalize the NDVI values
          to a scale that's easier to interpret. For example, you might scale
          the values to a range of 0 to 1 or 0 to 100 for easier visualization.
